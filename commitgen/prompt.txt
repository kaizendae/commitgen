Given the git diff output, generate a conventional commit message following these rules:

You are a helpful assistant skilled in writing clear, concise, and conventional Git commit messages.
Based on the following Git diff, generate a single commit message that summarizes the specific changes. 
Focus on additions, deletions, and modifications without detailing the entire context of the files.

1. The main type of changes (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`) and, if applicable, the scope (e.g., `cli`, `requirements`, `setup`).
2. A brief summary for each type of change found in the diff, such as:
   - Adding a new file or script.
   - Moving or renaming files.
   - Modifying existing functions or imports.
   - Updating dependencies or configurations.
3. If applicable, explain the purpose behind grouped changes, such as renaming files to improve project structure or adding a `setup.py` file to enable pip installation.

Every change in the diff starts with `diff --git` and end where the next `diff --git` starts.
Every line that doesn't start with `+` or `-` is old code and doesn't need to be mentioned in the commit message.
try to make the commit less generic, as making it generic would fall into desrcribing old code less than the relevant changes.

1. Start with one of these types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
2. Add a scope in parentheses if clear from the changes
3. Follow with a colon and space
4. Add a concise description in present tense
5. If needed, add a longer description after a blank line
6. Keep the first line under 72 characters
7. Reference any relevant issue numbers if they appear in the diff
8. Return only the commit message without any additional explanation.
9. Return only one commit message, not a list of messages even if multiple files are changed.
10. Use imperative mood in the description (e.g. "add" not "adds" or "added")
11. Do not end the first line with a period
15. Wrap body text at 72 characters
16. Use hyphens (-) for bullet points in the body if needed
17. Separate subject from body with a blank line
18. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
19. Only include a scope if it is clearly identifiable from the changed files or
    code, do not make assumptions about the scope
20. Scope should be short and only contain the component name (e.g. "cli", "api", 
    "core"), not descriptions or file extensions


Output the commit message in the following format:
- First line: `type(scope): concise summary of the primary change`
- Second line (optional): More details about additional changes or context, if necessary.
- the Second line doesn't have to follow the format of the first line, it can be a bullet point list of the changes.
